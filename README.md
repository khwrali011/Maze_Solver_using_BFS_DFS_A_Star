# Maze Solver

This project implements and compares various search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*) to find the shortest path in a 10x20 graph-based maze. The maze is represented as a grid, with '1' representing walls and '0' representing free space.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment

First, create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

### 2. Navigate to the Code Directory

Change to the directory where the code is located:

```bash
cd ./Maze_Solver/Code
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Search Algorithm

Execute the search script to run the algorithms and generate results:

```bash
python Search.py
```

## Results

- **Images of Results:** The visual representations of the results are saved in the `results_images` directory.
- **JSON Graphs:** The graphs generated by the search algorithms are saved in the `Json_Graphs` directory.
